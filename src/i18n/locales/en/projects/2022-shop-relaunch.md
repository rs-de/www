- **Stack:** TypeScript, React, vite, ReactRouter, ReduxToolkit, RTKQuery, MUI, Cypress, github with actions, docker, portainer
- **Backend:** RESTFul APIs (extra team)

Beside UI implementation, code reviews and managing the development process,
I did the setup of the project from scratch including CI/CD with gitlab
(later github) and docker. This was my first project i used
[RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview). The overall
experience with it was very good. If a project is working with redux, I would
use RTKQuery again!
