## Thank you, Open Source!

If you are a software developer it is very likely that you leverage from open source,
either directly or indirectly. Several years ago I realized that I was using almost only open source
software for so many years, and I asked my self: "What have I done to contribute back to the community?".

How can we contribute? Here are some ways:

- Publish your own open source project
- [Contribute](https://opensource.guide) to an existing project with fixes or new features
- Donate to an open source project
- Write a blog post about an open source project
- Ask your company to sponsor an open source project
- As a stakeholder, ask your developers which project they use and how they contribute

I decided to go with two options:

1. I published own projects, and I decided to do this on github in context of a team ([pubcore](https://github.com/pubcore))
1. I donated small amounts on a monthly basis to 2 favorite projects I was using. [opencollective](https://opencollective.com/).

Even if most of the stuff you publish will not being used by others, it is a good experience to learn how to publish and maintain a project.
You never know what other people might find useful, even if something is "bad" it might be used to have "bad" examples!
So it happened to me: Most of the stuff I published, I do not use anymore, because other projects did better and I switched, but some got used (e.g. [iso-language-codes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iso-language-codes)).

Contribution to open source is no waste of time.
