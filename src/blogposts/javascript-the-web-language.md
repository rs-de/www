## JavaScript: The Web Language

If you think about human languages and assume you have to hire developers to build up a team you would very likely require the candidates to speak a language all understand, because human communication is obviously a key to work together efficiently and successfully. So it is clear there will be one primary "team language" everyone can speak.

But what about programming languages? Basically the same thing: If possible you would use one language to build it.

In the early days of my web development career it was normal to work with more than
one programming language to build web applications.
On the server side most of the time I used PHP (sometimes Java), on the client side JavaScript.
Beside the fact, that it would have been possible to build web apps only on the server side (and therefor only with one language of choice), it was always required to build user interfaces which are snappy and responsive:
Menu navigation should open and close fast, forms should be validated on the fly, and so on.
This has been done with JavaScript in the wast majority of cases. (Flash or Java applets were also a thing, but it was not so common).
So there was always a need to know JavaScript.

In 2009 node.js was released and from that point in time it was possible to use JavaScript on the server side, too.
How cool was that? It took some time for the community to build up the eco system (packaging system, libraries, etc.) and in 2014 I started to use it on server side!

Since then a lot has changed towards getting JavaScript better and better:
Better to use, my personal favorites are:

- [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions),
- [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) for array and objects,
- [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function),
- [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
- [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)
- [nullish coalescing operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator)

And TypeScript! Even I was a late adopter of TypeScript, I am very happy to use it now.

## Some facts about JavaScript in 2023

- JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world (see [stackoverflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022#most-popular-technologies-language) or [github](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages)). The consequences are:
  - Easier to find developers
  - Very good Community support
  - Good for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) (huge open source community => a lot of data)
  - Chance to find some libraries for your use case is better
- JavaScript is also heavily used for desktop (offline capable) applications (see [electron apps](https://www.electronjs.org/apps))
- Many mobile apps are build with JavaScript, e.g. with [react native](https://reactnative.dev/showcase)

## Conclusion

Since JavaScript/TypeScript is a feature rich, well supported and growing base of a huge eco system today, for me it is kind of an obvious decision to use it on server side too.
So, if you are going to build a new user interface, or rebuild an existing one, and on server side JavasScript is not used or not planned to be used: Consider to use it!

## Beware

Even JavasScript is very capable, it can and should _not_ being used for everything!
But especially for user interfaces and web applications it is very likely to be very good choice.
