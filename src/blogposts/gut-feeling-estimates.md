## Gut feeling estimates

How to get "rough" estimates of effort to fulfill some kind of work package?
Based on gut feelings: Estimation must be done by the one who will do
the work. Estimation result will be one of the following "natural" ranges

```
minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, quarters, years
```

#### Meaning

- minutes: 1 to 60 minutes
- hours: 1 to 24 hours
- days: 1 to 5 days
- weeks: 1 to 4 weeks
- months: 1 to 3 months
- quarters: 1 to 4 quarters
- years: 1 to open end

#### Usage for _receiver_ (the one who ask for estimate)

For instance, if you get the estimate "day", you know it may be one to 5 days.
Thats it. Do not ask for more accuracy. Just take it with you.  
It is up to the receiver to manage the "risk" which amount of days to use.  
**This will lead us to to get (good!) estimates very fast.**

Especially for longer ranges (starting with "week") it is important to ask
again, at least one time e.g. around 50% of the original estimated time has been
past. This allows us to use the developer's experience, which typically grows as we work on the project.
It is good to plan such a estimate-refinement from the beginning on, together with the developer.

#### Usage for _worker_ (the one who will do the work)

1. If you have really no idea, ask for a short time box ("minute" or "hour") to walkthrough the work. It is important to time-box this.
2. Walk through the units in mind, for instance: Is it possible in minutes? No. In Hours? No.
   In days? No. In weeks? Maybe => estimate is "week".

#### Prerequisites

1. Trust.
2. Networking tool to record _Shared Understanding_. Every participant has read and write access to it. The estimates must be visible there.

#### Motivation

Even in an agile development, the owner will ask for estimates.
This is something a developer has to accept. Most developers (or all!? ) do not
like estimates, and this is not without reason. It is not because they just
"do not like it". It is because they want to do it good, but they (especially
the experienced ones) know, it is not possible, or at least very time consuming to do it good.

Since agile development does not mean to have no plan or road-map, developers are required to give estimates, so what to do?

One option dev-teams choose is to use adjectives like "high", "medium" and "low" or colors "red", "yellow" "green" to signal a clue of effort size. This in order to get "vague" estimates, to reflect their inaccuracy or to avoid other people can "misunderstand" explicit times.
But the issue is that for all participants it is not obviously clear what this units mean (think of new team members).
What does it mean for a task to be a "high" effort? It is required to maintain some definition of this units.
This kind of units do not support communication, they complicate it. On the other hand,
If I get a statement like "This will take weeks" I know what it means. Why not plan with it?
